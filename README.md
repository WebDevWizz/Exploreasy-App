# Exploreasy-App
# Have you ever been in a new city and found yourself wandering around without a clear guide on what to do or see? Or maybe you missed the chance to attend a unique and memorable event just because you weren’t aware of it? 
# Sometimes it can be frustrating not to have updated information about local events when you're traveling. 

# That's why I created “ExploreEasy” - an app that can first of all inspire tourists in their local activities, BASED ON WHAT THEY LIKE. 
# But “Why should I use ExploreEasy?”. For 3 simple reasons: 
# - It can inspire me by giving me a list of events near to me in the main section, “the Discovery Section”; 
# -  	But in addition to the main section, I can also use the “Maps” section. Why? Because for example I’m probably interested going to an event in Vietri. 
# - But as I told you before, the app could be super useful for Organizers too. Because it allows you to easily add an event.

# NOTE: this is just a prototype.
